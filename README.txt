Another Game for my kids.

Ulterior Motive:
  Show them how *simple* games can be.
  Encourage them to want to create their own games (i.e. learn programming.)

The course:
  (0) made other game(s) (e.g. my fortune_teller gem)
  (0.1) tried a code-school (i.e. a javascript dragon game)
  (0.9) re-wrote my codez in Ruby
  (1) prompt -> press-enter -> random-action -> text response
  (2) prompt (w/ question) -> answer & press-enter -> semi-random-action -> text response
  (2.1) extract questions to yml
  (3) add sound effects... 
  (3.1) refactor, probably extract sounds to yml
  (4) associate levels & point(-range)s with questions
  (5) change display to use a game window
  (6) package and distribute game
