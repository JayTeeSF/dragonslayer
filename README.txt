Another Game for my kids.

Ulterior Motive:
  Show them how *simple* games can be.
  Encourage them to want to create their own games (i.e. learn programming.)

The course:
  (0) made other game(s) (e.g. my fortune_teller gem) [done]
  (0.1) tried a code-school (i.e. a javascript dragon game) [done]
  (0.9) re-wrote my codez in Ruby [done]
  (1) prompt -> press-enter -> random-action -> text response [done]
  (2) prompt (w/ question) -> answer & press-enter -> semi-random-action -> text response [done]
  (2.1) extract questions to yml [done]
  (3) add sound effects...  [done]
  (3.1) refactor, probably extract sounds to yml [tbd]
  (4) associate levels & point(-range)s with questions [tbd]
  (5) change display to use a game window [done]
  (6) add continue &/ submit button
  (7) package and distribute game
